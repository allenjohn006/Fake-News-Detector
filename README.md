# Fake-News-Detector
This project is a Fake News Detection system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, wrapped inside an interactive Streamlit web application. It analyzes news articles, extracts linguistic features, and uses a trained model to classify content as Real or Fake with confidence scores.
